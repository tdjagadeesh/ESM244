### Project Summary
This project examines characteristics of snowshoe hares in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest (BCEF). First, we consider the gender distribution of population over time by finding the proportion of females caught in traps. We then examine how average weight differs between female and male hares at three different study sites (bonbs, bonmat, bonrip). Data used in this projected was collected from 1999 to 2012 by Kielland et al. (2017) using the capture recapture method.

**Figure 1. Proportion of female snowshoe hares captured in traps annually (1999 2012).** Due to insufficient data 2002, 2003, 2004 and were omitted. Sample size is given by n. Proportion of females varies by year, with most years exceeding 50% female. Data source: Kielland et al. (2017)
